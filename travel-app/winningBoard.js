Visual Teachers teaching valuable things through some [[presentation slides / visual slides]]. As a Programmer I like to represent valuable things through some [[Code snippet]] (advanced code snippet of a language but simple if someone deeply knows that language.).

deeply engaged in a subject which has a huge ripple effects and which continuously reminds/nudge/saying me learning not going to stop.
Computer Science - Software Enginner
better learner - better thinker - improve math skills - think rationally - optimised things - always room for improvements (maintainability) - better organizer - better commnication.

You intended to learn a topic which introduced you to 10 diffenerent topics

// We left feeling this meeting was special for him, too.

// I never forgot that.

// I recently realized that in every meeting, I have the opportunity to make someone feel BIG or small. This is a simple way to make people feel big.
